                <h3>About temple</h3>
                <P>Kēdārnāth Mandir (Kedarnath Temple) is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions,
                    the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritriya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) from Kedarnath temple is carried down to Ukhimath
                    and where the deity is worshiped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Lord Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.[1] The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to
                    be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas,
                    the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[2] It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, expounded in Tevaram. Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[3][2] The temple is one of the four major sites in
                    India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas,
                    and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any "major" damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large
                    rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.[5][6]

                <h3>About Ladakh</h3>
                <P>About Ladakh history, the earliest inhabitants of Ladakh were the Khampa nomads, who domesticated yaks. The first settlement along the Indus River was established by Mons from the region of Kullu and another tribe called the Brokpas, toward
                    the west of Ladakh, originating from Giglit. Gya became the first seat of government of a Mon ruler who was known by the name of Gyapacho. Around 10th century AD in ladakh history, nomads from Khotan launched a series of bloody invasions
                    in Ladakh. Gyapacho succeeded in repelling the attack of the Khotan nomads with the help of Skilde Nimagon, the decendant Kin Tibet. Gyapocho ceded to him the uninhabited Shey and Thiksey village in return of his help. Nimagon became
                    the first king of Ladakh in ladakh history and chose Shey as the headquarter, and built a fort at Shey. Later he became the king of entire Ladakh region. Skilde Namagon ruled from 975 to 1000 AD. Between 1000 and 1500 AD Ladakh was
                    ruled by succession of kings, who were great patrons of art and architecture. They were responsible for building palaces and promoting religious activities amongst other things. By the beginning of the 19th century in Ladakh history,
                    the Mughal empire had misshapen, and Sikh rule had been established in Punjab and Kashmir. However the Dogra region of Jammu remained under its Rajput rulers, the greatest of whom was Maharaja Gulab Singh whose General Zorawar Singh
                    entered Ladakh in 1834. King Tshespal Namgyal was deposed and exiled to Stok. Ladakh came under Dogra rule and was integrated into the state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. It still upheld substantial independence and connections with
                    Tibet. Throughout the Sino-Sikh war from 1841 to 1842 in history of Ladakh, the Qing Empire attacked on Ladakh and the Sino-Tibetan army was crushed. The Dogras led by Zorawar Singh invaded Ladakh in 1834. King Dorjay Namgyal of Ladakh
                    managed to hold the Dogra army at Mulbek for a few months. Eventually, they had to surrender. Ladakh was placed under the control of Gulab Singh and his Governer. This followed a constant strife by the Ladakhis to regain their freedom
                    in Ladakh history. This bloody period ended with the advent of the British as the paramount power in North India. Ladakh was incorporated in the newly created state of Jammu and Kashmir.

                    The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/;[4] lit. 'Crown of the Palace', [taːdʒ ˈmɛːɦ(ə)l])[5] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah
                    Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
                    house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal
                    complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project
                    employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of
                    Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million
                    visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                    court" (Punjabi pronunciation: [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]), also known as Golden Temple, is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[2][3] It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.[2][4] The Gurdwara is built around
                    a man-made pool (sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.[5][6] Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mir Mian Mohammed, a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation stone in 1589.[7] In 1604, Guru Arjan
                    placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site Ath Sath Tirath (lit. "shrine of 68 pilgrimages").[2][8] The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed
                    several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan and the Mughal Empire.[2][4][9] The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage and blood of cows.[2][10]
                    Maharaja Ranjit Singh after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overlaid the sanctum with gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.[11][12][13] The Gurdwara is spiritually the most
                    significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the Gurdwara became a center of conflict between the Indian
                    government led by Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a militant movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking to create a new nation named Khalistan. In 1984, Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star,
                    leading to deaths of over 1,000 militants, soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. The Gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.[4][14] The Harmandir
                    Sahib is an open house of worship for all men and women, from all walks of life and faith.[2] It has a square plan with four entrances, has a circumambulation path around the pool. The complex is a collection of buildings around the
                    sanctum and the pool.[2] One of these is Akal Takht, the chief center of religious authority of Sikhism.[4] Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community
                    run kitchen that serves a simple vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.[4] Over 100,000 people visit the holy shrine daily for worship.[15] The Gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and
                    its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.[16]

                    Mysore Palace is a historical palace and a royal residence at Mysore in the Indian State of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi
                    Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort. The land on which the palace now stands
                    was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The current structure
                    was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors.

                    The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in
                    Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011.[1][2] This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between
                    the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy.[3] Influenced by over 450 years of Portuguese rule and Latin
                    culture, Goa presents a somewhat different representation of the country to foreign visitors.[4] Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches
                    and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. As of 2013, Goa was the destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons, with limited means who wanted to party. The state was hopeful
                    that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic.[5] On 24 November 2017, Delta Corp Limited claimed to have set up the first casino game training course centre in India at Goa.

                    The Ajanta Caves are 30 (approximately) rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 CE in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state of India.[1][note 1] The caves include paintings and rock-cut sculptures described
                    as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture, pose and form.[3][4][5] According to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that
                    influenced the Indian art that followed.[6] The caves were built in two phases, the first phase starting around the 2nd century BCE, while the second phase was built around 400–650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief period
                    of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.[7] The site is a protected monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India,[8] and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Ajanta Caves constitute
                    ancient monasteries and worship-halls of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.[9][10] The caves also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from
                    Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.[9][11][12] Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.[9]
                    While vivid colours and mural wall-painting were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.[13] Panoramic view of
                    Ajanta Caves from the nearby hill The Ajanta Caves are mentioned in the memoirs of several medieval-era Chinese Buddhist travellers to India and by a Mughal-era official of Akbar era in the early 17th century.[14] They were covered
                    by jungle until accidentally "discovered" and brought to Western attention in 1819 by a colonial British officer Captain John Smith on a tiger-hunting party.[15] The caves are in the rocky northern wall of the U-shaped gorge of the
                    river Waghur,[16] in the Deccan plateau.[17][18] Within the gorge are a number of waterfalls, audible from outside the caves when the river is high.[19] With the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is one of the major tourist attractions of Maharashtra.
                    It is about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from Fardapur, 59 kilometres (37 miles) from the city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, India, 104 kilometres (65 miles) from the city of Aurangabad, and 350 kilometres (220 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai.[9][20]
                    Ajanta is 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Ellora Caves, which contain Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves, the last dating from a period similar to Ajanta. The Ajanta style is also found in the Ellora Caves and other sites such as the
                    Elephanta Caves, Aurangabad Caves, Shivleni Caves and the cave temples of Karnataka.[21]

                    Varanasi (Hindustani pronunciation: [ʋaːˈraːɳəsi] (About this soundlisten)), also known as Benares,[8] Banaras (Banāras [bəˈnaːrəs] (About this soundlisten)), or Kashi (Kāśī [ˈkaːʃi] (About this soundlisten)), is a city on the banks of the river Ganges
                    in Uttar Pradesh, India, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Allahabad. A major religious hub in India, it is the holiest of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism
                    and Jainism, and played an important role in the development of Buddhism and Ravidassia. Varanasi lies along National Highway 2 and is served by Varanasi Junction railway station and Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport. Varanasi
                    grew as an important industrial centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion
                    of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the
                    Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. Tulsidas wrote his epic
                    poem on Rama's life called Ram Charit Manas in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas.[9] Guru Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507, a trip that
                    played a large role in the founding of Sikhism. In the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though
                    much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Bhumihar Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence
                    in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge
                    margin. Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the Diesel Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. Varanasi Hospital's foundation stone was laid by the then governor
                    Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi in 1954 and it was inaugurated by former president S. Radhakrishnan in 1964.[10] Varanasi has been a cultural centre of northern India for several thousand years, and is closely associated with the Ganges.
                    Hindus believe that dying here and getting cremated along the banks of the "holy" Ganges river allows one to break the cycle of rebirth and attain salvation,[11] making it a major center for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide
                    for its many ghats, embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat and the Harishchandra
                    Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here. The Ramnagar Fort, near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the Mughal style of architecture
                    with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, and the Durga Temple. The Kashi Naresh (Maharaja of
                    Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city,
                    and it was the place where the Benares gharana form of Hindustani classical music was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, Aj, was first
                    published in 1920.
